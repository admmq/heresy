* My literate Emacs config
Yet another attempt to make a literate config for my favorite text "operating system".
I tried to make it cross platform, but my main focus is [[https://guix.gnu.org/][Guix]].

First, let's load my modules. I ignore errors, that's needed because of the way Guix build elisp packages.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'stuff/packages "src/packages.el" 'noerror)
  (require 'stuff/config "src/config.el" 'noerror)
  (require 'stuff/exwm "src/exwm.el" 'noerror)
#+END_SRC

And I need to provide all my module so they can be used.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (provide 'stuff)
#+END_SRC
